## Problem formulation

Many users in their daily life try to save money in order to save money and use that for further use. Therefore in order to simplify their work and help them to save money and track their expense this application is the best practice to work with. With the rapid development of cost and expense, we thought that we will try to savemoney so if user is not able to track the expense or find difficulty in having the record then user can use the application for their personal use and save as much they want because this will help one to have daily expense record.
Money wastage irritates every person while doing purchase. So, in our expense tracking app there will be no case of wastage of money. We will also try that our users are benefited with the application advantages.
